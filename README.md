A Studi Ghibli film database.

## Motivation

For this project, I plan to create a Studio Ghibli database. All movie details will be populated using an API call. This database will showcase all films and individual film details. It will also have a feature to save favorite movies. The project is created using React's Link and Router. This project was created for practice using React.
